First install dependencies with pip:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

You will also need to download sip and PyQt. More detail is given
in the GENFIRE documentation.

http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/installation.html

Finally, install GENFIRE with

$ python setup.py install

You can verify that the install worked with

$ python -c "import GENFIRE"

If no errors occur, the installation was successful.
